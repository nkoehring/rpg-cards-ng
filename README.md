New and shiny replacement for the slightly outdated and clunky [RPC Cards Generator](https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/generator/generate.html). Not yet usable.

## Project goals

 * [x] comfortable, mobile optimized interface
 * [x] handle decks of cards in a wysiwyg way
 * [x] save decks in your browser
 * [ ] load icons from rpg-icons directly
 * [ ] allow icons to be stored locally (in browser)
 * [ ] offline mode
